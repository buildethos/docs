# Ethos Identity Safe

The Ethos Identity Safe is a private, self-sovereign digital vault designed to aggregate and protect digital profiles. Built using cutting-edge zero-knowledge (ZK) proof technology, The Ethos Identity Safe ensures utmost privacy, allowing you to **selectively disclose aspects of your identity without revealing private information**.

## Digital Identity Aggregation

Users can integrate a variety of digital accounts and profiles into one consolidated space. Examples of supported digital identities include:

* Web3 accounts such as Ethereum addresses
* Web2 accounts from platforms like Github, Telegram, Spotify
* Ethos Identifiers (anonymous identifiers for native applications)

## Selective Data Sharing

Within the Ethos Identity Safe, each digital identity or account is associated with a set of attributes. Users can choose which attributes are disclosed when interfacing with different platforms, applications, or services. Users retain autonomy to decide the level of information they are comfortable sharing.

## Digital Identity Verification

The Ethos Identity Safe allows users to verify their ownership of digital profiles through cryptographic schemas. Importing accounts into the Identity Safe creates a unique hash identifier used to prove user ownership and attributes of digital profiles.
