# Selective Disclosure

Selective disclosure refers to the ability to selectively reveal specific details of your digital identity, rather than sharing the entirety of your data.

## How Ethos Enables Selective Disclosure

* **Attribute Selection:** Each digital profile or account consists of various attributes. Choose which attributes you'd like to disclose and which ones to keep private.
* **Encryption:** After local encryption and secure transportation of user information, a zero-knowledge hash is created, letting you verify your data's authenticity without revealing its content.
* **Secured Storage and Retrieval:** Encypted data and verification hash proofs are safely stored within the Ethos Data Layer. Upon request, and with user authentication, data is retrieved securely.
* **Interaction with Enterprises:** Businesses can query for your data after obtaining your permission. With ZK-proofs, they can verify data authenticity without seeing its raw content.
